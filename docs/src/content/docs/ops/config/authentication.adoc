title: Authentication
---

XTDB provides authentication to control database access and secure connections. 
Authentication rules determine which users can connect and what credentials they must provide.

== Authentication Providers

XTDB supports two authentication providers:

* **User Table** (`!UserTable`): Uses an internal user table with password-based authentication
* **OpenID Connect** (`!OpenIdConnect`): Integrates with external identity providers like Keycloak, Auth0, AWS Cognito or Azure Entra.

== User Table

The `!UserTable` authentication method uses an internal user table with password-based authentication.

=== Configuration

[source,yaml]
----
authn: !UserTable
  rules:
    # admin always requires a password
    - user: admin
      method: PASSWORD
    # We trust local connections
    - remoteAddress: 127.0.0.1
      method: TRUST
    # Everything else requires a password
    - method: PASSWORD
----

=== User Management

**Default User**::
The `pg_user` table contains a default user "xtdb" with password "xtdb".

**Creating Users**::
[source,sql]
----
CREATE USER alan WITH PASSWORD 'TURING'
----

**Modifying Users**::
[source,sql]
----
ALTER USER ada WITH PASSWORD 'LOVELACE'
----

**Password Validation**::
When `PASSWORD` method is specified, credentials are validated against the `pg_user` table entries.

== OpenID Connect (OIDC)

The `!OpenIdConnect` authentication method integrates with external identity providers like Keycloak, Auth0, AWS Cognito or Azure Entra.

=== Basic Configuration

[source,yaml]
----
authn: !OpenIdConnect
  issuerUrl: https://your-keycloak.example.com/realms/master
  clientId: xtdb-client
  clientSecret: !Env OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
  rules:
    - user: oidc-client
      method: CLIENT_CREDENTIALS
    - method: PASSWORD
----

For complete OIDC configuration, setup guides, and troubleshooting, see link:authentication/oidc[OpenID Connect Authentication].

== Rule Configuration

XTDB controls database access through authentication rules that match users and IP addresses to determine the required authentication method.

=== Authentication Rules

Authentication rules are evaluated in order until the first match. If no rules match, the connection is rejected.

**Rule Parameters**::
* `user` (optional): Match specific username
* `remoteAddress` (optional): Match IP address or CIDR block (IPv4 or IPv6)
* `method` (required): Authentication method to use

**Available Methods**::
* `TRUST`: No authentication required
* `PASSWORD`: Require username/password validation
* `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`: OAuth client credentials flow (OIDC only)
* `DEVICE_AUTH`: OAuth device authorization flow (OIDC only)

**Example Rule**::
[source,yaml]
----
- user: admin
  remoteAddress: 127.0.0.1
  method: PASSWORD
----

This rule requires the `admin` user to provide a password when connecting from `localhost`.

**Server Configuration**::
Authentication rules are configured at server startup and apply to both Postgres wire protocol and HTTP connections. 
For HTTP, authentication must be provided with each request as HTTP is stateless.
