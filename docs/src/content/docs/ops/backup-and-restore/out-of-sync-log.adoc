title: Scenario - Out of Sync Log & Intact Storage
---

If the transaction log is unexpectedly out of sync — for example, due to topic deletion, rotation, or truncation — but the indexed storage still exists, XTDB will refuse to start.  
This is a safety mechanism designed to prevent divergence between the transaction log and the object store.

You may encounter an error such as:

> "*Node failed to start due to an invalid transaction log state (epoch=0, offset=200) that does not correspond with the latest indexed transaction (epoch=0 and offset=289).*"

or:

> "*Node failed to start due to an invalid transaction log state (the log is empty) that does not correspond with the latest indexed transaction (epoch=0 and offset=289).*"

== What Is Preserved

If storage remains intact, all previously indexed data is still available:

* Full queryable state up to the last successfully indexed transaction

== What Is Lost

Any recently submitted transactions that were not indexed — whether due to being lost, truncated, or deleted from the log — are **unrecoverable** unless they were separately backed up.

== Recovery Strategy: Using Epochs

XTDB provides a mechanism called an `epoch` to reset the transaction log tracking and allow recovery.

For full details about epochs, see link:/ops/config/log#epochs[Epochs].

=== Recovery Steps

. *Shut down all XTDB nodes* +
Before making any changes, ensure all cluster nodes are stopped to avoid inconsistencies.

. *Determine the current epoch value* +
Refer to the startup error message for the current epoch — typically `0` for a fresh installation.

. *Choose a new `epoch` value* +
Select an integer greater than the previous epoch — usually `epoch + 1`.

. *(Optional) Prepare a clean log state* +
If the log backend is not already empty, you need to create a new topic / directory for the log. 
Ensure the log backend (e.g., Kafka, local disk) is writable and correctly initialized before restarting.

. *Update the node configuration* +
Set the new `epoch` value in your node’s log configuration. 
See link:/ops/config/log#epoch-configuration[Epoch Configuration].

. *Restart all nodes together* +
Once all configurations are updated, restart the cluster nodes at the same time.
XTDB will skip offset validation and begin writing to the log under the new epoch.

. *(Optional) Re-submit any lost transactions* +
If you are aware of any missing transactions, manually reissue them or restore them via your application’s recovery layer.

== Notes & Warnings

* Beginning a new epoch will make the recovery of unindexed transactions from any previous epoch nearly impossible. 
** Therefore, it is recommended to _only_ increment the epoch after you are confident that the original log is irrecoverable and you understand the potential consequences.
* Always take a backup of storage before making epoch changes.
* The new epoch marks a clean slate for the log but does *not* delete any existing storage files.
* All nodes must use the same epoch value. Mismatched epochs will cause startup failures.
