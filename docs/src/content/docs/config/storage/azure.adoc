Azure Blob Storage can be used as a shared object-store for XTDB's remote storage module.

[NOTE]
====
The Azure Blob Storage module uses an Event Grid topic and Service Bus Topic to maintain a local copy of the file listings on Azure, saving on expensive/lengthy operations to list objects on Azure Blob Storage.

If not using the link:#resource-manager[Resource Manager template], ensure that you have a similar setup to track file changes on whichever storage account/container you are using, and that XTDB has relevant permissions to use all of the services. 
====

== Setup

First, ensure the `com.xtdb/xtdb-azure` Maven dependency is added to your XTDB node.

=== Infrastructure

[#resource-manager]
[NOTE]
.Resource Manager template
====
We provide a https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/main/modules/azure/azure-resource-manager/azure-stack.json[parameterized 'Azure Resource Manager' stack] to help set up everything that you need.
====

To use Azure Blob Storage as the object store, the following infrastructure is required:

. An **Azure Storage Account**.
.. A **Storage Account Container** within the storage account.
. An **EventGrid System Topic**, subscribed to blob creation/deletion events on the container.
. A `standard` tier **Service Bus Namespace**
.. A **Service Bus Topic** within the namespace (this should have a low time to live for messages).
. A Custom Role Definition, granting XTDB permission to:
.. Use the created storage container (Get, Put, Delete and List)
.. Read messages sent to **EventGrid**
.. Create Subscriptions on the **Service Bus Topic**

=== Authentication

Authentication is done via the Azure SDK, which uses the *DefaultAzureCredential*. See the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable[Azure Documentation] for setup instructions.

== Configuration

To use the Azure module, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  objectStore: !Azure
    # -- required

    # --- At least one of storageAccount or storageAccountEndpoint is required

    # The name of the storage account which has the storage container
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    storageAccount: storage-account

    # The full endpoint of the storage account which has the storage container
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # storageAccountEndpoint: https://storage-account.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
    
    # The name of the blob storage container to be used as the object store
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    container: xtdb-container

    # --- At least one of serviceBusNamespace or serviceBusNamespaceFQDN is required

    # The name of the service bus namespace which contains the serviceBusTopicName
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    serviceBusNamespace: xtdb-service-bus

    # The fully qualified domain name of the service bus namespace which contains the serviceBusTopicName
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # serviceBusNamespaceFQDN: xtdb-service-bus.privatelink.servicebus.windows.net

    # The name of the service bus topic which is collecting notifications from the container
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    serviceBusTopicName: xtdb-service-bus-topic

    # -- optional
    # A file path to prefix all of your files with
    # - for example, if "foo" is provided, all XTDB files will be located under a "foo" sub-directory
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # prefix: my-xtdb-node
    #
    # Azure Client ID of a User Assigned Managed Identity -
    # required when using them for authentication to Azure Services ie, inside of an Azure App Container.  
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # userManagedIdentityClientId: user-managed-identity-client-id
