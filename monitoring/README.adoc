= Monitoring

== User Guide

XTDB provides prebuilt Grafana dashboards for monitoring.  
We assume you already have a Grafana instance running with Prometheus configured to scrape your XTDB cluster or nodes (e.g. via Kubernetes).

If so, you can import the dashboards from the `public-dashboards/` directory into Grafana:

. Navigate to *Dashboards → New → New dashboard*.
. Click *Import dashboard*.
. Under *Upload dashboard JSON file*, upload the desired file from `public-dashboards/`.
.. Select your *Prometheus* data source.
.. Click *Import*.

XTDB provides two dashboards:

* *XTDB Cluster Monitoring* – an overview of cluster health and performance.
* *XTDB Node Debugging* – detailed insights into individual node behavior.

== XTDB Developer Guide

For local development, a monitoring stack can be started via Docker Compose. This setup runs:

* *Prometheus* – metrics collection
* *Grafana* – visualization, preloaded with dashboards and a Prometheus data source

Grafana is preconfigured to:

* Use Prometheus as the default data source
* Automatically load dashboards from `monitoring/public-dashboards/`

Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from `localhost:8080`.  
This assumes the monitored service:

* Exposes metrics at `:8080/metrics`
* Is reachable *from inside the Prometheus container* at:
** `172.17.0.1:8080`

Start the stack with:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

If you then go to http://localhost:3000/dashboards - you can log in (`admin/admin`) and work on/use the dashboards.

=== Exporting Dashboards

When updating or creating dashboards, export them to both the *developer* and *public* dashboards directories.

* For *dev-dashboards*:
. Click *Share*.
. Open the *Export* tab.
. Click *Save to file*.

* For *public-dashboards*:
. Click *Share*.
. Open the *Export* tab.
. Select *Export for sharing externally*.
. Click *Save to file*.

Replace the existing files in the relevant directories with your updated versions.

=== Scraping Multiple Nodes

To scrape multiple XTDB nodes or services:

. Ensure each node exposes its `/metrics` endpoint on a discoverable port.
. Update `prometheus.yml` with either static targets or service discovery.

Example (`prometheus.yml`):

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'xtdb-nodes'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['172.17.0.1:8080', '172.17.0.1:8081']
----
